You need to load all the files in your spheretables.scp
You need to create the following folder structure:

IN YOUR MAIN FOLDER! NOT INSIDE SCRIPTS FOLDER!
generador/items/armor/
generador/items/armor/colored/
generador/items/armor/magic/
generador/items/weapon/
generador/items/weapon/magic/

FUNCTIONS.
USE THEM ON THE CONSOLE.

How to use:
f_SphereGenerateArmors  > Generates regular armors.
f_SphereGenerateWeapons > Generates regular weapons.
Remove your old scripts, or update them, resync or close and reopen shard.

f_SphereGenerateArmorsColored > Generates colored armors  (bronze, copper, gold)
f_SphereGenerateArmorsMagic   > Generates magic armors    (hardening, invul)
f_SphereGenerateWeaponsMagic  > Generates magic weapons   (ruin, force, vanquish)
