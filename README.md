# SphereX-ScriptsVault
Hi! I'm sharing a bunch of my scripts with the community. Some of them may be mine alone, some of them may be remixes. Please, let me know if I forget to put any credits on it. 
Most of the texts in these scripts are in Spanish (since it is my native language), in some of them I added the original cliloc number, it should not be difficult to translate.  
Feel free to contact me on Discord if you find any bug or error in the scripts. Also, a thank you message is always welcome if you use them!  
Enjoy!
  
## Items
Bunch of custom items.
+ **HomeStones**: Stones that will change your home town for a fee. Use .fSetupHomeStones to automatically create them in every city.
+ **MoongatesOldStyle**: Old style public moongates (step and go to random city). Use .fSetupMoongates to spawn them.
+ **PotionKeg**: Revisited version of the potion keg. Found issues using MORE1, so moved the potion type to a tag. MORE2 is the level of potion (average of all the potions levels inserted).
+ **ReagentCase**: In spanish, especiero, idea from an old server, it allows you to have a case in your house to store all your reagents and retrieve them by amount or pack.
  
## Skills
Use and read SkillWait.scp before doing anything. This is a mandatory, otherwise skills won't work. It is also required to include all the function files from the main folder.  
+ **Animal Lore**: Opens a dialog showing the stats and some valuable information from the pet. For barding difficulty, check the barding skills section.
+ **Begging**: Allows to get some coins or food some vendors. Limited to not exploit a single spot.
